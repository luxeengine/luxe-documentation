:::tip[Outcome / Goals]{icon="puzzle"}
In this tutorial we'll **create a new project using the luxe launcher**.   
Then, we'll **use our code editor to open + run** the game.
:::

## Creating a new project

:::caution[Do this first if you haven't!]
Before we begin, make sure you've installed luxe and code editor support!   
[Visit the install page here](../../get.md) if you haven't yet.
:::

In the luxe launcher application, we'll find a **create button** in the middle near the top of the window. 
Click this to choose a project outline to use for the new project.

For this tutorial, we'll make a new project using the `empty` outline.
Select it to be taken to the outline config page. An outline is a project template.

In this outline, there aren't many settings! Just a name, and a location to save the project.

:::note[Make an empty folder for your project]
**Create a new folder** somewhere, and then select it using the `...` button.   
You are selecting where the project files will go, so it must be empty.
:::

Once you hit create, it will show the project in the project list (see next image).

## Stepping stones

The luxe launcher is used for managing projects, engine versions and modules.

We used it to create a project to manage, but what can we do with it now that it's created?

- Run the project as a game 
- Edit the project code and content via a code editor
- Edit the project content via the luxe editor
- Make a build of the project as a game we can share with others

**We're going to be using the code editor to run the game.**  

To do that the launcher has a shortcut for us to use to open it!
Once we switch to the code editor, we won't need to launcher as much for now.

## Running the project

For the next step, we'll want to open the project in Visual Studio Code.  
You can use the code editor icon that is highlighted. 

*Moving your mouse over these icons will describe what they do*.

As another option, you can use `Open Folder...` in Visual Studio Code.  
Select the same folder you just created, and it will open as a luxe project workspace.

## The project entry point

Your project usually contains a file called `game.wren`.   
This is a text file but our code editor will color the words and make it easier to understand.

If you select `game.wren` on the left hand side bar, it should open the contents inside the main view.

## Running the game

Now that we have a game, we need to be able to run it to test it.  
Let's run the game and see what the empty template creates for us.

**With the main code editor window showing our `game.wren` file:**

:::tip[Do this: Press the Build + Run keys]{icon="seti:todo"}
<KbdPicker />
_default key bindings_:   
<Kbd mac="Command+Shift+B" other="Control+Shift+B" />
:::

<details>
<summary>Alternative: using the Terminal main menu...</summary>
An alternative option is to use `Terminal` from the main menu, and choose `Run Build Task...`. This shows a list of options, find the `luxe` options and within that, `luxe: run`.
</details>

**Try it!**

If nothing went wrong you should see a window with the luxe logo that follows the mouse. 

:::note[First run takes a second]
The first run might take a little bit to compile all the module content, but the next run should be much quicker!
:::


## Next up...

If you look around your `game.wren` file you might notice a `ready` function, and the `tick` function. 

- `ready` - Here is where you can load a level, make a menu show up. It's what happens first, and you control what happens next.
- `tick` - This function runs once every frame, and is where we can make the game update and draw.
- 
In the next tutorial, we'll learn about receiving input, and make a small game!
