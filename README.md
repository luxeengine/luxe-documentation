# Luxe game engine documentation

The luxe documentation is built with Astro + Starlight!

## Building the docs

To build the documentation, you can run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to work on it locally.
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
